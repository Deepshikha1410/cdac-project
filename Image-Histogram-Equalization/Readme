Image Histogram Equalization

Overview

This C program applies histogram equalization to a JPEG image. 
Histogram equalization is a technique used to enhance the contrast of an image by modifying the pixel values.

Usage
Compile the program using gcc:

Bash
gcc -o histogram_equalization histogram_equalization.c -ljpeg

Run the program and enter the name of the JPEG image file when prompted:
Bash
./histogram_equalization

Enter the JPEG image file name: input_image.jpg

The program will save the equalized image as equalized_image.jpg in the same directory.

Functions
readJPEG(const char *filename, unsigned char **data, int *width, int *height): Reads a JPEG image file and stores the pixel data in data.
writeJPEG(const char *filename, unsigned char *data, int width, int height): Writes the pixel data to a JPEG image file.
histogramEqualization(unsigned char *data, int width, int height): Applies histogram equalization to the pixel data.

Notes
The program uses the libjpeg library for JPEG image processing.
The program assumes that the input image is in RGB color space.
The program applies histogram equalization to the entire image, without considering individual color channels.
